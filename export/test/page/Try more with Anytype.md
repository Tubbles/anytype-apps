# Try more with Anytype

## **Collaborate**   
All Spaces and Chats are **fully private** – only members you invite can access them.   
- Go to Space settings → Members → Copy link.   
- Choose the type of invite link:   
    - **Editor** (full edit access)   
    - **Viewer** (read-only)   
    - **Request approval** (new members request access, you approve and assign roles)   
   
Each Space or Chat can only have one active link at a time. Switching between Editor/Viewer/Request access creates or disables links accordingly.   
   
## **Publish to the Web**   
Publish individual Objects as web pages:    
- Open any Object → Tap **⋯ **(three-dots) menu → Publish to Web.    
- Customize the part of the link after the `/` if you’d like.    
- Upgrade the membership to reserve your personal subdomain on `any.org`
